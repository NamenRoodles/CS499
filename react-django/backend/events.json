Jon Sargent's use of black and white photography featuring the male nude figure in natural settings defines his ideas of masculinity in our present time. \"May this exhibit give us a sense that masculine places are where men belong, find meaning in responsibilities, and are defined through their choices.\" Maria Battista's sculptures heighten the theme through bronze and alabaster. Public and private-commission sculptor Maria Battista births figures and portraits that are engaged in wonderment about the nature of reality. She is the owner-artisan of First Circle Studios, her space for the emergence of bronze, stone, and precious metal sculptures that celebrate the embodiment of spirit in the human being. Chris Alvarez's oil paintings show the viewer places that Chris identifies as masculine. Now a well-known figure drawing and painting teacher in the Pikes Peak region, Chris taught drawing at UCCS. After teaching a decade at the Cottonwood Center for the Arts, Chris opened the Alvarez Art School in 2010, where he teaches drawing and painting to adults and children.",

Growing up in post-World War II Japan, Otake studied dance and performance in Europe before moving to New York in 1976. For more than four decades, she was part of Eiko & Koma, a collaborative that created performance, choreography, visual design, sound, videos, and texts. Since 2014, Otake has worked as a soloist and has directed her own projects in collaboration with other artists. Otake\u2019s first museum solo-exhibition, I Invited Myself, Vol. II, foregrounds the artist\u2019s video and media, which have developed alongside her dance, choreography, and performance installations. Spanning from 1980 to the present, the works on view feature a body as it moves in and through various spaces, including the urban infrastructure of Tokyo and New York and the vast landscapes of Wyoming and California.",

        "Time": "10:00 am",
        "Description": "Landscape has been an important inspiration for artists across generations, and it played an important role in the foundation of this very institution. The soaring peaks of the Southern Rocky Mountains were a popular motif for many students and teachers of the Broadmoor Art Academy, founded in Colorado Springs in 1919, which evolved into the Fine Arts Center. Attracting renowned artists from across the country, mostly of European descent, the academy fostered a reverence for the natural landscape. But many depicted Colorado\u2019s striking scenery as empty of human presence, ready to be explored for the benefit of the artist and viewer alike. Landscape remains important for contemporary artists, yet many have a dramatically different relationship to the genre. The five artists featured in Contested Terrains acknowledge how human intervention has shaped landscapes across the Americas. Joiri Minaya, for example, makes a connection between the Caribbean tourist economy and the arrival of the first European colonizers in Haiti. Nina Leo and Moez Surani present a view of the Great Lakes from Canada looking toward the US, offering a mournful homage to the unfifilled potential of a global superpower. Carolina Aranibar-Fern\u00e1ndez looks at sites of extraction across the Americas. And Rosa Barba documents how transportation and development have altered a landscape in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil with shocking repercussions for the local community. Together, these artists extend the potential of landscape as a genre, and allow it to function as an entryway to overlooked histories, acknowledging how politics, power, and extraction have shaped the Americas as we know them today. Contested Terrains is organized by Katja Rivera, Curator of Contemporary Art. Support of the exhibition is generously provided by the Holaday Fund.",

        "Description": "\u201cAs scientists and artists, we are all observers of the world. We are all interpreters and storytellers,\u201d said Dr. Gosnell. \u201cWe hope people leave this experience feeling a closer connection to the universe and with an understanding that the story of science belongs to all of us. We can build a more welcoming world from the stories we tell.\u201d The Gift is an immersive installation that animates contemporary astrophysics research to open up metaphorical space for grief, care, and renewal. In this experience, participants enter a music-filled reading room, where they encounter an all-ages illustrated book\u2014based on the astrophysics research of Dr. Natalie Gosnell, Assistant Professor of Physics at Colorado College\u2014that invites responses both tactile and emotional. This book tells the story of two stars that are so close to one another yet so far from us that they appear as a single point of light in the sky. Their fates are intertwined; one star, at the end of its life, transfers its material to the companion, allowing the companion to burn brighter and to appear\u2014for a moment\u2014younger, brighter, bluer. This tender story and playful experience heeds the call of anthropologist Emily Martin, to \u201cwake the sleeping metaphors of science.\u201d The Gift is a collaborative project between Janani Balasubramanian, Dr. Natalie Gosnell, and Dr. Andrew Kircher. The book features artwork by Amy Myers and design by Katie Hodge. The original score is by Tina-Hana\u00e9 Miller with arrangement by Solomon Hoffman.",

He has resided in Colorado Springs for many years, but has rarely shown in the Springs, so we are so excited for you to see his work. About the Exhibit: For many years, I have incorporated fused glass elements into my bronze figurative compositions. This show represents more exploration with bronze and terracotta into themes around water represented by resin and by kiln-cast glass. My work gravitates toward uplifting and inspirational themes, often ancient themes, leveraging the figure\u2019s range to draw out transcendent truth and contemporary messages of hope and redemption. Within this context, my emphasis is on composition. Be it animals, skiers, or children, I am looking for the right posture, the most natural stance, the proper spacing, the perfect tension to make the work sculpturally compelling. I strive for conceptual consistency from the style and patina through to the presentation on the base. - Clay Enoch opening: APRIL 7th, 5-9 pm artist talk: Monday, April 17th, 5:30 pm exhibit on display through April 28th",
